        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - in interpreted language code is executed line by line and in compiled language code is converted into machine code by a compiler before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution. instead of crashing the program itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - finally block always runs, no matter if an exception is occurs or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - logging in python is to track events that happen while a program runs.\n",
        "  like INFO, DEBUG, ERROR.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - __del__ method in python is a destructor method used to clean up resources,when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - when you use import (module_name), you import the entire module and access its functions or variables\n",
        "  - from (module) import (specific_function), you import only specific items\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - using generic exception like except Exception as e: .\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - it ensures that the file is properly closed after its block of code is executed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - multithredding uses multiple threads within the same process, threads share the same memory space. while multiprocessing uses multiple processes, each with its own memory space,don’t share memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - helps with Debugging, improves monitoring & maintenance, saves error details for later analysis, supports different logging levels like (DEBug,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL),enhances security.\n",
        "\n",

        "  - an except block to catch specific exceptions.\n",
        "  - use a generic except block to catch all exceptions\n",

        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  -\n",
        "DEBUG\tDetailed diagnostic information for debugging\n",

        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - closing a file in python is essential for proper resource management and preventing potential issues like memory leaks or data corruption.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() – reads the entire file\n",
        "  - file.readline() – reads one Line at a time\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - logging module in python is used to track events and errors while a program runs. it helps with debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - the os module in python provides functions for interacting with the operating system, including handling files and directories.\n",

        "  - in python,can manually raise an exception using the 'raise' statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - because it allows programs to perform multiple tasks concurrently."
